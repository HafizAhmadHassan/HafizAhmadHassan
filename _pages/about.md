Hafiz Ahmad Hassan is Master of Science Student and Researcher in the University College London.

I currently teach undergraduate courses covering innovation, entrepreneurship, product development and leadership in the department's [Business-Engingeering-Technology](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/twc/bet-program/index.html) minor, and support related initiatives at the [Thomas Walter Center for Technology Management](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/twc/index.html). I am also a member of the teaching team for three graduate-level classes in Product Development and Engineering Econ / Finance.

My academic and research interests are broad, encompassing data science, simulation, and visualization. For my dissertation I plan to apply methods from those areas to improve our understanding of processes related to innovation and product development processes.

Meanwhile, I continue to maintain [GUNSTRUCTION](https://gunstruction.net), which I founded in 2012. In 2020 it logged nearly 90 million user interactions across web, iOS, and Android devices.
